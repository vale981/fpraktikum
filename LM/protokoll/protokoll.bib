abstract = "The mean stopping power for high-energy muons in matter can be described by 〈−dE/dx〉=a(E)+b(E)E, where a(E) is the electronic stopping power and b(E) is the energy-scaled contribution from radiative processes—bremsstrahlung, pair production, and photonuclear interactions. a(E) and b(E) are both slowly varying functions of the muon energy E where radiative effects are important. Tables of these stopping power contributions and continuous-slowing-down-approximation ranges (which neglect multiple scattering and range straggling) are given for a selection of elements, compounds, mixtures, and biological materials for incident kinetic energies in the range of 10 MeV to 100 TeV. Tables of the contributions to b(E) are given for the same materials."
